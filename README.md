# picospc: a browser-hosted simulation of a minimal stored-program computer

A web page that helps introduce students to the fundamental concepts of computing by showing a minimal stored-program computer consisting of an IP (instruction pointer) register, some number of 8-bit memory registers, and a Step button. A minimal instruction set with a trivial encoding is provided. Some example programs can be shown using a drop-down menu at the top of the page.
